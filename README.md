### Stateset Network Setup


1) Install the Stateset Network locally via Git:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/stateset/stateset

```

2) Deploy the Nodes


```bash

cd stateset && gradlew.bat deployNodes (Windows) OR ./gradlew deployNodes (Linux)

```

3) Run the Nodes

```bash

cd workflows
cd build 
cd nodes
runnodes.bat (Windows) OR ./runnodes (Linux)

```
4) Run the Spring Boot Server

```bash

cd ..
cd ..
cd server
../gradlew.bat bootRun -x test (Windows) OR ../gradlew bootRun -x test

```
The Stateset Network API Swagger will be running at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/`

To change the name of your `organisation` or any other parameters, edit the `node.conf` file and repeat the above steps.

### Joining the Network

Add the following to the `node.conf` file:

`compatibilityZoneUrl="https://stateset.network:8080"`

This is the current network map and doorman server URL

1) Remove Existing Network Parameters and Certificates

```bash

cd build
cd nodes
cd PartyA
rm -rf persistence.mv.db nodeInfo-* network-parameters certificates additional-node-infos

```

2) Download the Network Truststore

```bash

curl -o /var/tmp/network-truststore.jks https://stateset.network:8080//network-map/truststore

```

3) Initial Node Registration

```bash

java -jar corda.jar --initial-registration --network-root-truststore /var/tmp/network-truststore.jks --network-root-truststore-password trustpass

```
4) Start the Node

```bash

java -jar corda.jar

```

To teardown all of the nodes and server:

```bash

taskkill /f /im java.exe

```

#### Node Configuration

Configuration 

- Corda version: Corda 4
- Vault SQL Database: PostgreSQL
- Cloud Service Provider: GCP
- JVM or Kubernetes


#### Database Configuration

The node configuration on deploy is setup to leverage Postgres using the Cloud SQL Instance

```bash

   node {
        name "O=StateSet,L=San Mateo,C=US"
        p2pPort 10011
        rpcSettings {
            address("localhost:10030")
            adminAddress("localhost:10070")
        }
        cordapps = []
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["ALL"]]]
        extraConfig = [
                'dataSourceProperties' : [
                        'dataSourceClassName' : 'org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource',
                        'dataSource.url' : 'jdbc:postgresql://<DATABASE_NAME>?cloudSqlInstance=<INSTANCE>&socketFactory=com.google.cloud.sql.postgres.SocketFactory&user=<USER>&password=<PASSWORD>&currentSchema=stateset',
                        'dataSource.password' : 'password',
                        'dataSource.user' : 'user'
                ],
                'database': [
                        'transactionIsolationLevel' : 'READ_COMMITTED'
                ],
                'jarDirs': '[/stateset-network/drivers]'
        ]
        webPort 8080
        // extraConfig = ['h2Settings.address' : 'localhost:12347']
        webserverJar = "${rootProject.projectDir}/server/build/libs/server-${project.version}.jar"
    }
```

In order to use the GraphQL engine on the Stateset Network; the schema, user and password will need to be created on Postgres:

```bash

CREATE USER "my_user" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'my_password';
CREATE SCHEMA "my_schema";
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA "my_schema" TO "my_user";
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES ON ALL tables IN SCHEMA "my_schema" TO "my_user";
ALTER DEFAULT privileges IN SCHEMA "my_schema" GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES ON tables TO "my_user";
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL sequences IN SCHEMA "my_schema" TO "my_user";
ALTER DEFAULT privileges IN SCHEMA "my_schema" GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON sequences TO "my_user";
ALTER ROLE "my_user" SET search_path = "my_schema";

```

### Network States

Customer States are transferred between stakeholders on the network.

#### Accounts

The first state to be deployed on the network is the `Account`. Version 0.1 of the `Account` State has the following structure:

```jsx

// *********
// * Account State *
// *********

data class Account(val accountId: String,
                   val accountName: String,
                   val accountType: TypeOfBusiness,
                   val industry: String,
                   val phone: String,
                   val yearStarted: Int,
                   val annualRevenue: Double,
                   val businessAddress: String,
                   val businessCity: String,
                   val businessState: String,

                   val controller: Party,
                   val processor: Party ) : ContractState, QueryableState {


```

The Account has the following business `flows` that can be called:

- `CreateAccount` - Create an Account between your organization and a known counterparty on the DSOA

                   val firstName: String,
                   val lastName: String,
                   val email: String,
                   val phone: String,
                   val controller: Party,

                val firstName: String,
                val lastName: String,
                val company: String,
                val title: String,
                val email: String,
                val phone: String,
                val country: String,
                val controller: Party,

We created the `Carmen Dashboard` to provide the ability for organizations to create `Accounts`, `Contacts`, and `Leads` with counterparties on the network.


#### Cases


```jsx

// *********
// * Case State *
// *********

data class Case(val caseId: String,
                val description: String,

Testing
-------

Testing and code review needs to be implemented on the Stateset Network.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
